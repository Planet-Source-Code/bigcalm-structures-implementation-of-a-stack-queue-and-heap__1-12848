</div>

### Description

For all those jaded ex-Computer Science students out there, here's a revisitation of certain data structures which are taught to be useful. Includes a Stack, Queue, and Binary Heap (occasionally called a Binary Tree). These are fast, well tested, and should provide you with useful functionality for virtually any programming you do.
